	abstract = {Blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) were exploited extensively around the world and remain endangered. In the North Pacific their population structure is unclear and current status unknown, with the exception of a well-studied eastern North Pacific ({ENP}) population. Despite existing abundance estimates for the {ENP} population, it is difficult to estimate pre-exploitation abundance levels and gauge their recovery because historical catches of the {ENP} population are difficult to separate from catches of other populations in the North Pacific. We collated previously unreported Soviet catches and combined these with known catches to form the most current estimates of North Pacific blue whale catches. We split these conflated catches using recorded acoustic calls from throughout the North Pacific, the knowledge that the {ENP} population produces a different call than blue whales in the western North Pacific ({WNP}). The catches were split by estimating spatiotemporal occurrence of blue whales with generalized additive models fitted to acoustic call patterns, which predict the probability a catch belonged to the {ENP} population based on the proportion of calls of each population recorded by latitude, longitude, and month. When applied to the conflated historical catches, which totaled 9,773, we estimate that {ENP} blue whale catches totaled 3,411 (95\% range 2,593 to 4,114) from 1905–1971, and amounted to 35\% (95\% range 27\% to 42\%) of all catches in the North Pacific. Thus most catches in the North Pacific were for {WNP} blue whales, totaling 6,362 (95\% range 5,659 to 7,180). The uncertainty in the acoustic data influence the results substantially more than uncertainty in catch locations and dates, but the results are fairly insensitive to the ecological assumptions made in the analysis. The results of this study provide information for future studies investigating the recovery of these populations and the impact of continuing and future sources of anthropogenic mortality.},

	abstract = {Conflicts between humans and predators are the product of socio-economic and political landscapes and are particularly controversial because the resources concerned have economic value and the predators involved are high profile and often legally protected. We surveyed the current literature for information on ecological and social factors common to human–predator–prey conflicts. We used this information to examine whether losses to predators and patterns of investment in husbandry could be linked to these factors. We found that livestock losses to predators were low and were negatively associated with net primary productivity and predator home range sizes, but were not affected by predator density, methods of husbandry or human population density. While there was no effect of husbandry on losses, variation in husbandry was explained by net primary productivity, predator density and percentage of stock killed by predators. Inconsistent and sparse data across conflicts may have limited our ability to identify important factors and resolve patterns, and suggests that there is no reliable or consistent framework for assessing and managing human–predator conflicts that involve game and livestock species. Our approach highlights the type of data that could be very informative to management if collected across a range of cases and habitats.},

	abstract = {Aim  Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and introduced species, we examined how our understanding of range shifts may be informed by the more established study of non-native species introductions. Location  Marine systems world-wide. Methods  Database and citation searches were used to identify 129 marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread rates were based on studies for which post-establishment spread was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of functionally similar introduced species having ecologically similar impacts. Results  Our review and meta-analyses revealed that: (1) 75\% of the range shifts found through the database search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems, and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for range-shifting species. Main conclusions  Although marine range shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it is well-established that introduced species are a primary threat to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions, range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be affected faster than terrestrial ones as species shift with climate change. Regardless of habitat, consideration of range shifts in the context of invasion biology can improve our understanding of what to expect from climate change-driven shifts as well as provide tools for formal assessment of risks to community structure and function.},

For herring, {MSVPA} produced greater abundance estimates than single-species assessments, especially for the youngest age classes. The average rate of predation mortality for herring aged 0 and 1 was also higher than the standard total natural mortality rate (0.2) for the 21-year time frame (0.84-3.2). The same was true for mackerel in this {MSVPA} (0.37-1.6). Consumptive removals of herring and mackerel generally increased over time. From 1999 to 2001, the biomass removed by predators exceeded each species' commercial landings. The sum of consumption and landings notably exceeded the multispecies maximum sustainable yield for herring for the years 1995-2002 and for mackerel for the period 1999-2002.

Many experimental studies have revealed that the rate at which this process occurs depends critically on the resource concentration, a relationship called "functional response." However, whether the concentration of the consumer normally affects the functional response has been the subject of a long-standing, predominantly theoretical, debate in ecology. Here we present an experimental test between the alternative hypotheses that food uptake depends either only on the resource concentration or on both the resource and the consumer concentrations. In short-term laboratory experiments, we measured the uptake of radioactively labeled, unicellular green algae (Monoraphidium minutum, resource) by the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus (a consumer) for varying combinations of resource and consumer concentrations. We found that the food uptake by Brachionus depended on the algal concentration with the relationship best described by a Holling type 3 functional response. We detected significant consumer effects on the functional response only at an extraordinarily high Brachionus density (similar to 125 rotifers/{mL}), which by far exceeds concentrations normally encountered in the field. We conclude that con sumer-dependent food uptake by planktonic rotifers is a phenomenon that can occur under extreme conditions, but probably plays a minor role in natural environments.},

Yet 63\% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context.

Fisheries scientists often assume the number of young fish entering a population (recruitment) is related to the biomass of spawning adults and that recruitment dynamics do not change over time. Thus, managers often use a target biomass based on spawning biomass as the basis for calculating sustainable catches. However, we show recruitment and spawning biomass are not positively related over the observed range of stock sizes for 61\% of 224 stocks in the {RAM} Legacy Stock Assessment Database. Furthermore, 85\% of stocks for which spawning biomass may not drive recruitment dynamics over the observed ranges exhibit shifts in average recruitment, which is often used in proxies for target biomasses. Our results suggest that the environment more strongly influences recruitment than spawning biomass over the observed stock sizes for many stocks. Management often endeavours to maintain stock sizes within the observed ranges, so methods for setting management targets that include changes within an ecosystem may better define the status of some stocks, particularly as climate changes.},

Although there are methods for an automatic detection of discontinuities in a time series, their performance drastically diminishes at the ends of the series. Since all the methods currently available require a substantial amount of data to be accumulated, the regime shifts are usually detected long after they actually occurred. The proposed sequential algorithm allows for early detection of a regime shift and subsequent monitoring of changes in its magnitude over time. The algorithm can handle the incoming data regardless whether they are presented in the form of anomalies or absolute values.

	abstract = {The 1991 Benguela Ecology Programme Workshop on Seal-Fishery Biological Interactions outlined an approach to examine the qualitative effects of culls of a seal population on catches and catch rates of commercial fisheries. This paper applies that approach to examine the effects of possible culls of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus on catches and catch rates of the bottom-trawl fishery for the Cape hakes off the South African west coast. The approach involves constructing a ?minimal realistic model? of the hake-seal system. The model considered here includes the two species of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, the Cape fur seal and an ?other predatory fish? component. Values for parameters of the model are derived from biological studies and by fitting to abundance indices for the hake and seal populations. The model is able to mimic the catch rate information for hake satisfactorily for a range of scenarios for the carrying capacity of the seal population, although the trend in hake abundance indicated since seal harvests commenced some four centuries ago until the start of the hake fishery in 1917 is, of course, questionable. The impact of the seal culls examined on the hake fishery is minimal (and can even be detrimental) for the base-case model, which takes account of both hake species and assumes that seals do not prey on the deep-water hake species M. paradoxus. This result is insensitive to changes to the values of most of those parameters of the model that are not well known. However, increasing the extent of predation by seals on M. paradoxus leads to greater projected benefits for the hake fishery under a future seal cull. It seems likely that a change in the future pattern of fishing to reflect a greater relative fishing intensity {uponM}. capensis would have a similar result. The conclusions of the paper will not necessarily apply to other southern African regions where the M. paradoxus : M. capensis is much lower than on the South African west coast.},

	abstract = {Abstract The biomass of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus in the Gulf of Maine–Georges Bank ({GOM}–{GB}) region declined sharply in the mid- to late 1970s, when fishery harvests ranged from 300 to 400 kilo–metric tons (kt) per year. During this same period, the consumption of Atlantic herring by fish and marine mammal predators was very large. Consumption has greatly exceeded landings from 1985 to the present. Previous research showed that four groups of predators (demersal fishes, marine mammals, large pelagic fishes, and seabirds) together annually consumed over 200 kt of Atlantic herring during the 1970s and over 300 kt during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Our analyses indicate that Atlantic herring predation mortality rates are related to the abundance of both Atlantic herring and predators. Predation mortality rates were relatively low during the 1960s, when Atlantic herring were abundant, but increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Atlantic herring declined. Predation mortality rates declined in the 1990s as Atlantic herring abundance increased. Biological reference points for the Atlantic herring complex (composed of two stocks) are significantly different when predation mortality is included. Several methods were used to assess the available fishery yield given that predator requirements have first been satisfied. In general, all of the approaches indicated that the maximum sustainable yield harvest level for the {GOM}–{GB} Atlantic herring complex is lower than that estimated from the single-species assessment in which predation effects are not explicitly accounted for.},

	abstract = {The potential of predation to structure marine food webs is widely acknowledged. However, available tools to detect the regulation of prey population dynamics by predation are limited, partly because available population data often aggregate a population's age structure into a single biomass or abundance metric. Additionally, many food webs are relatively complex, with prey species subject to different assemblages of predators throughout their ontogeny. The goal of this study was to evaluate the extent to which stage-structured predation could be reliably detected from time series of total biomass of predators and prey. We simulated age-structured populations of four mid-trophic level fish species with distinct life history traits, exposed them to variable predation at different life stages, and fit production models to resulting population biomass to determine how reliably the effects of predators could be detected. Predation targeting early life history and juvenile life stages generally led to larger fluctuations in annual production, and was therefore more detectable. However, ecologically-realistic levels of observation error and environmental stochasticity masked most predator signals. The addition of predation at a second life stage sharply decreased the ability to detect the effect of each predator. We conclude an absence of detectable species interactions from biomass time series may be partly due to the interactive effects of environmental variability and complex food web linkages and life histories. We also note that predation signals are most robust for predator-prey systems where predators primarily act on mortality of sub-mature life history stages. Simulation testing can be applied widely to evaluate the statistical power of analyses to detect predation effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

In order to further our understanding of how the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems influence and regulate patterns of fisheries production, and how they are affected by this triad of drivers, a comparative approach is required. We apply a system-level surplus production modeling approach to the total aggregated catch and biomass of all major targeted fish species in 12 exploited Northern Hemisphere ecosystems. We use 2 variations of a surplus production model: a regression model and a dynamic model, each fit with and without environmental and biological covariates. Our aims were to explore (1) the effects of common drivers at the basin scale and their relative influence within the triad of drivers among systems, (2) the impact of covariates on biological reference points and implications for fisheries management, and (3) the relationship between maximum sustainable yield ({MSY}) and production. Our results show that the environment affects estimates of system-level {MSY} across all ecosystems studied and that specifically water temperature is a major influence on productivity. Emergent properties of northern hemisphere systems suggest that {MSY} values and optimal exploitation rates are relatively consistent: {MSY} ranges between 1 and 5 t km(-2) and optimal exploitation rate between 0.1 and 0.4 yr(-1). Finally, we suggest that the relationship between fisheries yield and primary production is not as simple as suggested in other studies.

By failing to consider current knowledge, therefore, natural resource scientists and managers may be harming the species and systems they are charged with protecting. Most ecologists agree that the conservation of biodiversity is facilitated by maintaining population densities and distributions of strongly interactive species above estimable thresholds for ecological effectiveness. Assuming that conservation biologists and natural resource managers are "physicians to nature," we therefore propose they are obligated to adhere to a doctrine of "best conservation practices based on the best science," applying a more rigorous standard for the management of relatively interactive species than may be mandated by older statutes and effected by current practice and convention.},

Yet, to date, there have been few systematic studies that examine how scientists understand the barriers that impede such outreach. Through analysis of 97 semi-structured interviews with academic biologists and physicists at top research universities in the United States, we classify the type and target audiences of scientists’ outreach activities. Finally, we explore the narratives academic scientists have about outreach and its reception in the academy, in particular what they perceive as impediments to these activities. We find that scientists’ outreach activities are stratified by gender and that university and disciplinary rewards as well as scientists’ perceptions of their own skills have an impact on science outreach.

	abstract = {The decline in aboveground wood production after canopy closure in even-aged forest stands is a common pattern in forests, but clear evidence for the mechanism causing the decline is lacking. The problem is fundamental to forest biology, commercial forestry (the decline sets the rotation age), and to carbon storage in forests. We tested three hypotheses about mechanisms causing the decline in wood growth by quantifying the complete carbon budget of developing stands for over six years (a full rotation) in replicated plantations of Eucalyptus saligna near Pepeekeo, Hawaii. Our first hypothesis was that gross primary production ({GPP}) does not decline with stand age, and that the decline in wood growth results from a shift in partitioning from wood production to respiration (as tree biomass accumulates), total belowground carbon allocation (as a result of declining soil nutrient supply), or some combination of these or other sinks. An alternative hypothesis was that {GPP} declines with stand age and that the decline in aboveground wood production is proportional to the decline in {GPP}. A decline in {GPP} could be driven by reduced canopy leaf area and photosynthetic capacity resulting from increasing nutrient limitation, increased abrasion between tree canopies. lower turgor pressure to drive foliar expansion, or hydraulic limitation of water flux as tree height increases. A final hypothesis was a combination of the first two: {GPP} declinus, but the decline in wood production is disproportionately larger because partitioning shifts as well. We measured the entire annual carbon budget (aboveground production and respiration, total belowground carbon allocation [{TBCA}], and {GPP}) from 0.5 years after seedling planting through 61/2, years (when trees were similar to25 in tall). The replicated plots included two densities of trees (1111 trees/ha and 10 000 trees/ha) to vary the ratio of canopy leaf mass to wood mass in the individual trees, and three fertilization regimes (minimal, intensive, and minimal followed by intensive after three years) to assess the role of nutrition in shaping the decline in {GPP} and aboveground wood production. The forest closed its canopy in 1-2 years, with peak aboveground wood production, coinciding with canopy closure, of 1.2-1.8 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1). Aboveground wood production declined from 1.4 yr(-1.) at age 2 to 0.60 kg C-m(-2). kg, C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at a yr(-1) at age 6. Hypothesis I failed: {GPP} declined from 5.0 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 2 to 3.2 kg C(.)m(-2 .)yr(-1) at age 6. Aboveground woody respiration declined from 0.66 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 2 to 0.22 kg C.m(-2.) yr(-1) at age 6 and {TBCA} declined from 1.9 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr{\textbackslash}(-1) C, C, at age 2 to 1.4 kg C(.)m(-2.)yr(-1) at age 6. Our data supported hypothesis 3: the decline in aboveground wood production (42\% of peak) was proportionally greater than the decline in canopy photosynthesis (64\% of peak). The fraction of {GPP} partitioned to belowground allocation and foliar respiration increased with stand age and contributed to the decline in aboveground wood production. The decline in {GPP} was not caused by nutrient limitation, a decline in leaf area or in photosynthetic capacity, or (from a related study on the same site) by hydraulic limitation. Nutrition did interact with the decline in {GPP} and aboveground wood production, because treatments with high nutrient availability declined more slowly than did our control treatment, which was fertilized only during stand establishment.},

Using Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) population assessments, fisheries statistics, and an acoustic database, as well as grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) diet studies, I demonstrate that contrary to a pelagic outburst, pelagic catches in research bottom trawls increased in several eastern Canadian ecosystems as these species increasingly occupied the suprabenthic habitat vacated by their diminishing groundfish predators.

Despite the imposition of strict management measures in force since the early 1990s, the Scotian Shelf ecosystem has not reverted back to its former structure. Here we provide evidence of the transient nature of this ecosystem and its current return path towards benthic fish species domination. The prolonged duration of the altered food web, and its current recovery, was and is being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. These erupting forage species, which reached biomass levels 900\% greater than those prevalent during the pre-collapse years of large benthic predators, are now in decline, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. This dampening, and the associated reduction in the intensity of predation, was accompanied by lagged increases in species abundances at both lower and higher trophic levels, first witnessed in zooplankton and then in large-bodied predators, all consistent with a return towards the earlier ecosystem structure. We conclude that the reversibility of perturbed ecosystems can occur and that this bodes well for other collapsed fisheries.},

	abstract = {A cost minimization model for supply of starch, oil, sugar, grassy and woody biomass for bioenergy in Denmark was developed using linear programming. The model includes biomass supply from annual crops on arable land, short rotation forestry (willow) and plantation forestry. Crop area distributions were simulated using cost data for year 2005. Five scenarios with different constraints, e.g. on food and feed supply and on nitrogen balance were considered focusing on: a) constraints as the year 2005, b) landscape aesthetics and biodiversity c) groundwater protection, d) maintaining current food and feed production, or e) on site carbon sequestration. In addition, two oil price levels were considered. The crop area distributions differed between scenarios and were affected by changing fossil oil prices up to index 300 (using 55\$ per barrel in 2005 as index\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;100). The bioenergy supply (district heating, electric power, biogas, {RME} or bioethanol) varied between 56\&\#xa0;{PJ} in the “2005” scenario at oil index 100 and 158\&\#xa0;{PJ} at oil index 300 in the groundwater scenario. Our simple model demonstrates the effect of prioritizing multiple uses of land resources for food, feed or bioenergy, while maintaining a low nitrogen load to the environment. In conclusion, even after drastic landuse changes the bioenergy supply as final energy will not exceed 184\&\#xa0;{PJ} annually (including 26\&\#xa0;{PJ} processed biowaste sources) by far lower than the annual domestic total energy consumption ranging between 800 and 850\&\#xa0;{PJ} yr−1.},

	abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the {USA}. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.},

Pelagic fish outbreak in the Northwest Atlantic - reality or illusion? – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 70: . The collapse of Northwest Atlantic groundfish in the early 1990s yielded a “natural experiment” within which to explore responses of ecosystems to a major perturbation. The “Pelagic Outburst” hypothesis was developed to explain an up to 900\% increase in the abundance of small-bodied forage fishes and macroinvertebrates following this collapse and a subsequent trophic cascade extending across four trophic levels. Recently, this theory has been challenged and an alternative “Suprabenthic Habitat Occupation” ({SHO}) hypothesis has been advanced; it proposes the prey outburst associated with the forage fish component was an illusion created by changes in the vertical distribution of small pelagic fishes after the cod collapse in favour of a more bottom-oriented distribution that increased their vulnerability to bottom trawls. We evaluated the {SHO} hypothesis as it applied to the relationship between changes in the biomass of cod and the vertical distribution of herring and sand lance, the major small pelagic species of the Scotian Shelf ecosystem off eastern Nova Scotia. Contrary to predictions of the {SHO} hypothesis our initial conclusion that a pelagic outburst occurred in that ecosystem was confirmed and we found no evidence of a predator effect on vertical distributions of these species. We also explored the acoustic survey design and execution that generated the data that form the cornerstone of the {SHO} hypothesis, and the coherence between the behaviour depicted in these data and catch rates in the surface-oriented purse-seine fishery for herring operating at the time of these surveys. In combination, the results of our re-analysis of the population dynamics and behaviour of herring on the eastern Scotian Shelf, lead us to conclude that the {SHO} hypothesis, at least as it relates to the post-cod collapse dynamics of the affected Northwest Atlantic ecosystems, is not supported.},

Old females show senescence in both survival and reproduction, These patterns of variation are independent of differences in body mass, taxonomic group, and ecological conditions. Differences in levels of maternal care may fine-tune the temporal variation of early survival. The immature stage, despite a low relative impact on population growth rate compared with the adult stage, may be the critical component of population dynamics of large herbivores. Observed differences in temporal variation may be more important than estimated relative sensitivity or elasticity in determining the relative demographic impact of various fitness components.},

The multispecies framework treats the single-species models and data as a special case of the multispecies model and data. The same data from fisheries and surveys are used to estimate model parameters for both single-species and multispecies configurations of the model. Additionally, data from stomach samples and predator rations are used to estimate the parameters of the multispecies model. One form of the feeding functional response, predator pre-emption, was selected using {AIC} from seven alternative models for how the predation rate changes with the densities of prey and possibly other predators. Differences in estimated population dynamics and productivity between the multispecies and single-species models were observed. The multispecies model estimated lower mackerel population sizes from 1964-2003 than the single-species model, while the spawning biomass of pollock was estimated to have declined more than three times faster since 1964 by the multispecies model. The variances around the estimates of spawning biomass were smaller for mackerel and larger for pollock in the multispecies model compared to the single-species model.},

	abstract = {Many marine ecosystems exhibit a characteristic “wasp-waist” structure, where a single species, or at most several species, of small planktivorous fishes entirely dominate their trophic level. These species have complex life histories that result in radical variability that may propagate to both higher and lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In addition, these populations have two key attributes: (1) they represent the lowest trophic level that is mobile, so they are capable of relocating their area of operation according to their own internal dynamics; (2) they may prey upon the early life stages of their predators, forming an unstable feedback loop in the trophic system that may, for example, precipitate abrupt regime shifts. Experience with the typical “boom-bust” dynamics of this type of population, and with populations that interact trophically with them, suggests a “predator pit” type of dynamics. This features a refuge from predation when abundance is very low, very destructive predation between an abundance level sufficient to attract interest from predators and an abundance level sufficient to satiate available predators, and, as abundance increases beyond this satiation point, decreasing specific predation mortality and population breakout. A simple formalism is developed to describe these dynamics. Examples of its application include (a) a hypothetical mechanism for progressive geographical habitat expansion at high biomass, (b) an explanation for the out-of-phase alternations of abundances of anchovies and sardines in many regional systems that appear to occur without substantial adverse interactions between the two species groups, and (c) an account of an interaction of environmental processes and fishery exploitation that caused a regime shift. The last is the example of the Baltic Sea, where the cod resource collapsed in concert with establishment of dominance of that ecosystem by the cod’s ‘wasp-waist” prey, herring and sprat.},

	abstract = {1. There is a current debate about the appropriateness of prey-dependent vs. ratio-dependent functional responses in predator-prey models. This is an important issue as systems governed by these models exhibit quite different dynamical behaviour. However, the issue is not yet resolved on a theoretical basis, and there is a lack of experimental evidence in natural systems. We used a paper wasp-shield beetle system in a natural setting to assess the validity of either approach.   2. We manipulated the abundance of herbivorous insect prey on thistle plants and of predatory paper wasps in the immediate environment of the prey by opening or closing cages containing wasp nests.   3. The number of wasps foraging at the site increased when cages were opened, but rapidly reached an asymptote, indicating predator interference. The predation rate per predator decreased with the number of wasps in the environment. Thus, the functional response depended on both prey and predator density.   4. Neither a pure prey- nor a pure ratio-dependent model fitted perfectly our observations. However, the functional response of the paper wasps towards shield beetle larvae was closer to ratio-dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence discriminating between ratio- and prey-dependence in a natural setting with unconfined predators and prey.   5. Predator interference was most probably responsible for the specific form of the functional response found. We found indications that both direct (e.g. aggression) and indirect interference mechanisms (e.g. depletion of easy-to-find prey) were at work in our system. We conclude that predator density cannot be ignored in models of predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {1. Until recently, the northern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina rugosa Ogilby, 1890) provided a seasonal source of protein for indigenous communities in tropical northern Australia. Today, feral pigs (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) exert a heavy predation pressure on C. rugosa, compromising subsistence harvest rates and threatening local persistence. 2. We investigated the influence of pig predation and harvest (subsistence and commercial) on C. rugosa persistence at discrete water holes using a stage-based matrix population model. Vital rates varied with wet season rainfall, pig predation and harvest. In addition, hatchling survival was density-dependent. 3. We show that field-based estimates of pig-related turtle mortality exceed levels that can be offset by increased hatchling survival, leading to predictions of rapid population decline and certain elimination of affected populations within 50 years. 4. Conversely, in the absence of pigs, compensatory increases in hatchling survival were sufficient to allow an annual harvest of up to 20\% of subadult and adult C. rugosa without causing extirpation or substantial population suppression. 5. Synthesis and applications. This demographic modelling shows that periodic local culling of pigs, fencing of wetlands to exclude predators, and hatchling supplementation to offset losses from predation are all viable management strategies for ensuring ongoing turtle harvests. Such demonstrations of the potential resilience of long-lived vertebrates under a properly managed harvest regime is important to convince natural resource agencies that conservation management for long-term viability need not exclude some degree of consumptive use. These findings are broadly relevant to applied ecology, providing important implications for the management of wildlife species subject to competing ecological pressures, such as subsistence and commercial harvesting and predation by invasive species.},

	abstract = {Organisms are expected to adapt or move in response to climate change, but observed distribution shifts span a wide range of directions and rates. Explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species, but general mechanisms have been elusive. We tested an alternative hypothesis: that differences in climate velocity—the rate and direction that climate shifts across the landscape—can explain observed species shifts. We compiled a database of coastal surveys around North America from 1968 to 2011, sampling 128 million individuals across 360 marine taxa. Climate velocity explained the magnitude and direction of shifts in latitude and depth much more effectively than did species characteristics. Our results demonstrate that marine species shift at different rates and directions because they closely track the complex mosaic of local climate velocities.
Local Speeding
Early responses of species to climate change seemed to predict a general poleward response (or upward in mountains and downward in the ocean). Pinsky et al. (p. 1239) test an alternative hypothesis that relates more to the nature of climate change than to changes in temperature. Using nearly 50 years of coastal survey data on {\textgreater}350 marine taxa, they found that climate velocity was a much better predictor of patterns of change than individual species' characteristics or life histories. The findings suggest that responses to climate change largely track changes in local conditions.},

	abstract = {Wildlife management in modern environments has to contend with an inheritance of faunal and landscape changes caused by humans which affect the relationships between predatory and prey species. In both game management for harvesting, and in species preservation, this leads to difficult decisions about whether and how to manage predation. Predator control by humans is as old as livestock husbandry. The deliberate, often organized, destruction of many mammalian predator species has been a feature of human development in Europe - and later in countries to which Europeans spread - for centuries. Destruction to the point of extinction was practised for a number of reasons (self-protection, protection of domestic stock, protection of wild game, fur, adventure, sport) which were rarely distinguished. Reduction of predator numbers specifically to allow an increased harvest of some game species was mainly a nineteenth century development, while the adoption of predator control to benefit endangered species for their own sake belongs to recent decades. We review scientific literature relevant to predator control in game management and in conservation. Understanding of the role of predation in prey population dynamics has changed considerably during the last 20 years, and predation is now credited with a much more powerful role than in the past. Increasingly it becomes possible not merely to understand what predator control achieves, but to predict when it might be valuable in management, and what strategy will best achieve the aims. Examples of conservation problems involving predation illustrate the complexity of decision-making in management. Because of habitat loss, habitat degradation, altered predator communities, or altered predator-prey ratios, predation losses often have increased significance in modern environments. Novel approaches potentially offer non-lethal ways to manage mammalian predators. However, most are still in an exploratory phase and there have been no unqualified successes. The best tested approach, excluding predators from small areas by fencing, is discussed. In Britain, predator control to benefit small game populations and allow harvesting has been practised for nearly 200 years, and has undoubtedly played a role in shaping the present-day fauna. Although earlier gamekeeping severely reduced the geographical range of several mammalian (and avian) predator species, nowadays predator control is subject to legal restrictions based on species' conservation status and humaneness. However, illegal persecution of species protected by law remains a persistent and significant conservation problem. The predator species legitimately targeted are successful, common and increasing in the modem environment, while wild populations of gamebirds and many other ground-nesting birds are declining seriously in most areas.},

Size-based feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size-prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20\% of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {\textgreater}50 \% of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes.

These nine objectives can be met simultaneously. The form of management that does so is described in this paper in its application to multi-species fisheries. It also applies in the management of fisheries harvesting from single populations, species, ecosystems or the biosphere. Such management would be based on empirically observed sustainability. In this paper, it is demonstrated how sustainable consumption from two groups of species in separate ecosystems is exemplified by the predators that feed on them. Such empirical examples are the result of a wide variety of factors, including the trial-and-error processes of evolution and various risks, including extinction, that impose limits. Implications for management are clear. Consumption rates by humans have been much too high and would have to be reduced significantly to match empirically proven sustainability at its maximum. Commercial takes of fish are far above the mean rates of consumption observed among predatory species in nature. It will be extremely difficult to implement the management that appears to be necessary. Nevertheless, consumption rates beyond the naturally observed limits have not been proven to sustainably avoid long-term risk. (C) 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Marine ecosystems are influenced by drivers that operate and interact over multiple scales, resulting in nonlinear or abrupt responses to perturbation. Because of the inherent complexity of marine ecosystems, progress towards an understanding of factors that affect fisheries production will be most efficient if researchers adopt a comparative approach across ecosystems using suites of indicators. The goals of this study were to explore a suite of biomass- and catch-based ecosystem response indicators for 9 northern hemisphere ecosystems relative to indices that capture the influence of fisheries, trophodynamic and environmental drivers, and to compare the relative influence of the triad of drivers. Partial least squares regression was used to explore relationships between the ecosystem response indicators and predictor drivers and to estimate the relative importance of each of the triad of drivers. Across ecosystems we have identified a few common observations: (1) environmental drivers, particularly temperature-related independent variables, are most likely related to total system biomass and biomass of specific biological groups (e.g. gadoid or clupeid fishes); (2) trophodynamic drivers are most relevant to the mean trophic level of community and the demersal-to-pelagic biomass ratio; and (3) fisheries drivers tend to be related to the catch-based indicators, such as fishing-in-balance and percent of primary production required to support fisheries. Overall, each of the triad of drivers was important for all ecosystems; however, the relative importance of each driver and the indicators they most affected varied among ecosystems, suggesting that an examination of a suite of indicators and drivers is required. A key finding is that fishing is categorically an important driver, but to explain biomass trends it is very important to consider environmental drivers as well.},

	abstract = {Cannibalism can be an important feature for several fish species. From an ecological perspective, studying cannibalism in the northwest Atlantic fish community usually results in examining silver hake Merluccius bilinearis population dynamics. From a population dynamics (and hence fisheries assessment) perspective, silver hake pose some unique challenges and have defied easy, standardized approaches for evaluation of stock dynamics. Thus, here we propose to examine one facet of silver hake dynamics in light of their known cannibalistic propensity. We show for the two U.S. northwest Atlantic stocks that the percent diet composition of silver hake in silver hake is quite high and has been quite consistent over time. We also explore the size composition of cannibalized individuals as well, noting that the 0–10 cm grouping is largely cannibalized by the 20–40 cm group, which is itself cannibalized by 40–60 cm group. From this, we fit stock-recruitment models (both Ricker and Beverton–Holt) that were typical and excluded cannibalism, that included cannibalism as an additional factor, and that changed the definition of the spawning stock biomass ({SSB}) from 20+ to those fish that are \&gt;40 cm. This latter shift resulted from the observed offset of recruitment production versus copious cannibalism as seen in the middle size group. Our results show that either the inclusion of cannibalism directly, or accounting for cannibalism indirectly by using a larger cutoff for the definition of {SSB}, are better model fits for both stocks than ignoring cannibalism for this species. We discuss the broader implications of including cannibalism for this species, for other cannibalistic species, for changes in how we consider recruitment—particularly those species managed with recruitment-based reference points— and for how these might alter perceptions of stock dynamics.},

We used data on cod and prey distributions and cod diet collected during the Barents Sea ecosystem survey. Local prey use, feeding success, spatial displacement and spatial overlap between cod ({\textgreater}2 yr) and prey (capelin, herring, polar cod, shrimp and macrozooplankton) were analysed. While prey species were found in spatially segregated habitats, cod were widely distributed, except the deepest parts of the Barents Sea where shrimps prevailed. Local diet reflected local prey availability. Cod abundance was higher in areas occupied by capelin and herring and lower in the northeastern areas occupied by polar cod. Feeding success increased with the local abundance of capelin and polar cod. Capelin were a targeted prey, and cod fed efficiently on capelin in the areas where they overlapped. Herring overlapped with cod, but feeding success did not increase with herring abundance, suggesting that herring might escape predation. Although feeding success increased with local polar cod abundance, polar cod had a spatial refuge in the northeastern part, which cod did not enter. Our analyses imply that the cod were spatially constrained and that their prey differed in suitability.},

Annual surplus production and average annual biomass were aggregated across stocks within each region to examine the relationship between total surplus production and total aggregated biomass. We fit two surplus production models (Graham-Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson) to the observed relationships to estimate maximum multi-species surplus production (equivalent to maximum sustainable yield) of the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems. Maximum multi-species surplus production was estimated to be approximately 2.5 x 10(6) t in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and 330 x 10(3) t in the Gulf of Alaska. These point estimates were smaller than the sum of single-species {MSY} proxies from recent stock assessments, and estimates for the Gulf of Alaska were much smaller than earlier estimates that were used to specify optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish complex. Therefore, optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska may need to be re-assessed to reflect more recent conditions.   We further estimated the effects of environmental variability on annual surplus production using correlations and generalized surplus production models with environmental covariates. Results suggest that surplus production in the Bering Sea may be lower during conditions associated with the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is characterized by warmer temperatures, reduced ice, and reduced wind mixing over the shelf. Similarly, surplus production on the Gulf of Alaska shelf was lower during years with warm bottom temperatures coupled with low salinities in late winter. If maximum multi-species surplus production varies as a result of environmental variability, optimum yield ranges for the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems should take such fluctuations into account.

Culling is widely practised as a means to reduce predation effects of terrestrial carnivores, birds and marine mammals in many parts of the world. Of marine mammals, coastal pinniped species have usually been the target of culling programs, but dolphins and a large odontocete have also been culled.

*
We reviewed the published literature on marine mammal culling programs to evaluate the extent of their efficacy as a fisheries management measure.

*
Changes in species' distributions and abundance demonstrate that culling programs can be very effective at reducing predator density.

*
Several conclusions from experimental studies of terrestrial mammals and birds may also apply to marine mammal control. Firstly, predator removal generally increases productivity and population size of target prey populations, but not always. Secondly, culling programs typically involve a large proportional reduction ({\textgreater}50\%) in predator populations.

*
Thirdly, the effects of culling are typically dependent on continued control, and in the absence of control the population rapidly returns to pre-culling density. This underscores the need for predator removal to be a long-term management strategy. Fourthly, culling predators often has non-intuitive and unintended consequences for target species and for other predator and prey species.

*
Marine mammal culling programs rarely have measurable objectives with respect to prey populations, and their success has not been evaluated. Culling marine mammals is controversial because of the following: (i) they are high-profile charismatic megafauna; (ii) many populations are recovering from a period of over-exploitation while others remain threatened or endangered; and (iii) the scientific evidence needed to justify a cull is usually highly uncertain.

*
Marine mammal culling programs should be based on scientific analysis with stated and measurable objectives to be evaluated during planned follow-up monitoring.},

Losses to predation can exceed losses to fisheries, yet is is often assumed fishing mortality alone is responsible for variation in fish survival. While it may be sufficient to forget predation in short-term prediction and management, this will not further longer-term prediction and management. The predation experienced by a population is influenced by environmental and biological factors that vary spatially, seasonally, annually, and with the abundance of itself, other prey species, and the predator species. Predation call directly regulate prey numbers and indirectly regulate their survival via habitat availability, individual growth, and trophic structure. Despite predation's pervasity, its complexity and variability complicate its prediction. Models of predation have shown assumptions made in single-species models to be incorrect, but numerical prediction may be reliable for only the simplest symmetrical predator-prey interactions, where ontogenetic changes in predator diet and prey vulnerability have been accounted for. Knowledge of the effects of predation in marine fisheries will be furthered by an ongoing commitment to test and explore the properties of managed fisheries, while preserving, as necessary, the productivity and buffering capacity of the natural system.

	abstract = {The yellownose skate (Dipturus chilensis) is one of the most important component of the commercial elasmobranch fishery off Chile with an extensive distribution range from 36 degrees 44' S - 55 degrees 13' S. Nevertheless, fishery management for this species does not extend beyond the central zone off Chile (36 degrees 44' - 41 degrees 28' S), leaving the southern zone (41 degrees 28' S - 55 degrees 13' S) without a proper fishing effort regulation. As a result, fishing pressure has increased dramatically in the southern zone, with unknown potential consequences for this elasmobranch population. In the absence of rigorous fishery-biological data, we used a matrix population model to assess yellownose skate demographic traits under different fishing mortality levels. A Leslie matrix model was implemented, where changes in age classes are defined in terms of of life history parameters. Uncertainty was incorporated by applying a Monte Carlo method to survival, age at maturity, and fecundity. Three scenarios were evaluated based on different assumptions about survival, fishing mortality rates, and age at 50\% of vulnerability. These scenarios showed a slow growth rate for population abundance (3-15\% per year) with no fishing exploitation. The population reaches equilibrium at low mortality levels (0.31 yr(-1)), which is consistent with estimates reported for other rajidae skates. The elasticity analysis indicates that juvenile survival contributes the most to variations in the population growth rate. The sustainable mortality rate has a positive, non-linear relationship with age at 50\% of vulnerability. Projections using different selectivity patterns showed that the population abundance is stable only when age-dependent fishing mortality removes individuals of older ages.

	abstract = {Measurements of the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are consistent with the hypothesis that it is trophic structure that controls the fraction of energy consumed at each trophic level, rather than energetics controlling trophic structure. Moreover, trophic structure is determined by competitive and predator-prey interactions. In freshwater pelagic communities, the collective efficiency of herbivorous plankton in consuming primary producers is up to 10 times as great as is the efficiency of forest herbivores in consuming their food. Conversely, forest predators are about three times as efficient in consuming herbivore production. as are zooplanktivorous fish. The presence of an additional level, piscivorous fish, in pelagic communities accounts for the difference. In the aquatic system, herbivorous zooplankton are freed from predation by the effect of piscivorous fish on their predators; in the terrestrial system, green plants are freed from herbivory by predation on the herbivores. We explain the contrast between freshwater pelagic systems and forests and prairies as follows: Pelagic ecosystems have more trophic levels as a result of selection for small rapidly growing primary producers, which cannot hold space in the fluid medium, in contrast to large space-occupying producers in the terrestrial environment. Consumers in pelagic systems are more frequently gape limited in the size range of food they can ingest than are grasping consumers in terrestrial systems. This difference makes for two largely distinct levels of predators in pelagic communities. The energy within the living, nondetrital components is more finely divided between trophic levels in pelagic systems than in terrestrial systems. Ecological efficiencies do not determine trophic structure; rather, they are its product.},

	abstract = {To understand how environmental changes have influenced forest productivity, stemwood biomass (B) dynamics were analyzed at 1267 permanent inventory plots, covering a combined 209ha area of unmanaged temperate-maritime forest in southwest British Columbia, Canada. Net stemwood production (?B) was derived from periodic remeasurements of B collected over a 40-year measurement period (19591998) in stands ranging from 20 to 150years old. Comparison between the integrated age response of net stemwood production, ?B(A), and the age response of stemwood biomass, B(A), suggested a 58 +/- 11\% increase in ?B between the first 40years of the chronosequence period (1859-1898) and the measurement period. To estimate extrinsic forcing on ?B, several different candidate models were developed to remove variation explained by intrinsic factors. All models exhibited temporal bias, with positive trends in (observed minus predicted) residual ?B ranging between of 0.40 and 0.64\%yr-1. Applying the same methods to stemwood growth (G) indicated residual increases ranging from 0.43 and 0.67\%yr-1. Higher trend estimates corresponded with models that included site index ({SI}) as a predictor, which may reflect exaggeration of the age-decline in {SI} tables. Choosing a model that excluded {SI}, suggested that ?B increased by 0.40 +/- 0.18\%yr-1, while G increased by 0.43 +/- 0.12\%yr-1 over the measurement period. Residual G was significantly correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2), temperature (T), and climate moisture index ({CMI}). However, models driven with climate and {CO}2, alone, could not simultaneously explain long-term and measurement-period trends without additional representation of indirect effects, perhaps reflecting compound interest on direct physiological responses to environmental change. Evidence of accelerating forest regrowth highlights the value of permanent inventories to detect and understand systematic changes in forest productivity caused by environmental change.},

	abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity   stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to   society(1-4), a concept that has become a common argument for   biodiversity conservation(5). Species-rich communities are thought to   produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the   complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar   ecosystem functions(6). Such variance dampening within communities is   referred to as a portfolio effect(7) and is analogous to the effects of   asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios(8). In ecology,   these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on   ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of   biologically relevant diversity within individual species(9). Current   rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of   magnitude higher than species extinction rates(10), so there is a   pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity   affect the performance of individual species in providing important   ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus   nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first   quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life   history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species.   Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than   it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population   rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently   consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population,   such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent   fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food   webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon   resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of   maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and   securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The   reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by   species loss alone.},

	abstract = {This essay comments on recent research on Darwinian fisheries science and on the future development of this field. From a practical point of view, the key question is: how fast are evolutionary changes caused by fishing happening? To answer this question, there is a need to understand intensities of selection generated by fishing, heritabilities and genetic correlations of the traits under selection, and whether the rates of change in traits predicted from this information are consistent with the changes observed. Although there is little doubt about the existence of phenotypic change in life-history traits of exploited fish stocks, there are few direct estimates of selection differentials caused by fishing. Results that are available, together with the relatively low heritabilities of life-history traits, suggest that the evolution caused by fishing occurs at a modest rate, and is likely to need a decadal time scale to be clearly observable. Given the pressing need for attention to fisheries in the short term, measures to control the longer-term evolutionary impact of fishing are most likely to be adopted if they also help to meet short-term objectives of management. With this in mind, the essay mounts a defence of large, old fish, the presence of which would be beneficial to stocks in the short term, and the conservation of which would set in motion selection for improved growth in the longer term.},

We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies.

We focus on food web relationships for four case-study species: Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus steno-lepis), longnose skate (Raja rhina), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), and squids (order Teuthoidea). For each, we present the species' position within the food web, evaluate fishing mortality relative to predation mortality, and evaluate diet compositions. We find that high trophic level ({TL}) species, whether commercially valuable (halibut) or incidentally caught (skates), have mortality patterns consistent with single-species assessment assumptions, where fishing mortality dominates natural mortality. However, assessments for commercially valuable (pollock) or incidentally caught (squids) mid-{TL} species can be enhanced by including food web derived predation information because fishing mortality is small compared with high and variable predation mortality. Finally, we outline food web relationships that suggest how production of species may change with diet composition or prey availability.},

Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model.

Herring spawn along the western coast of Norway, and the larvae are transported northwards to coastal areas of the southern Barents Sea where they spend their first two to four years. The abundance of immature herring year classes in the Barents Sea has been highly variable. One or a few strong year classes are usually followed by several poor year classes. In the study period, there were two particularly strong year classes (1991 and 1992). By 1996, these year classes had migrated out of the Barents Sea, and the abundance of young herring consequently decreased. In the period 1992–1999, the mean annual consumption of immature herring by minke whales in the southern Barents Sea varied considerably (640–118 000 t). The major part of the consumed herring belonged to the strong 1991 and 1992 year classes and there was a substantial reduction in the dietary importance of herring to whales after 1995, when a major part of both the 1991 and 1992 year classes migrated out of the Barents Sea. In 1992–1997, minke whales may have consumed 230 000 and 74 000 t, corresponding to 14.6 and 2.8×109 individuals of the herring year classes of 1991 and 1992, respectively.

As a consequence, stage structure can stabilize consumer–resource dynamics, create possibilities for alternative community states, modify conditions for coexistence of competitors, and alter the strength and direction of trophic cascades. Consideration of stage structure can thus lead to outcomes that are not expected based on unstructured approaches.},

	abstract = {In this article, we review evidence of how climate change has already resulted in clearly discernable changes in marine Arctic ecosystems. After defining the term ‘footprint’ and evaluating the availability of reliable baseline information we review the published literature to synthesize the footprints of climate change impacts in marine Arctic ecosystems reported as of mid-2009. We found a total of 51 reports of documented changes in Arctic marine biota in response to climate change. Among the responses evaluated were range shifts and changes in abundance, growth/condition, behaviour/phenology and community/regime shifts. Most reports concerned marine mammals, particularly polar bears, and fish. The number of well-documented changes in planktonic and benthic systems was surprisingly low. Evident losses of endemic species in the Arctic Ocean, and in ice algae production and associated community remained difficult to evaluate due to the lack of quantitative reports of its abundance and distribution. Very few footprints of climate change were reported in the literature from regions such as the wide Siberian shelf and the central Arctic Ocean due to the limited research effort made in these ecosystems. Despite the alarming nature of warming and its strong potential effects in the Arctic Ocean the research effort evaluating the impacts of climate change in this region is rather limited.},

	abstract = {Overfishing has caused dramatic changes in structures of exploited populations as well as ecosystems. In this article, we focus on fishing effects on age (size) and spatial structures of exploited fishes. Accumulating evidence has shown that large and experienced spawning individuals are able to produce higher quality and quantity of eggs, known as maternal effects, and that individuals of different age classes tend to spawn in different locations and times. These behaviors are associated with a healthy age structure and contribute to bet-hedging capacity that is important in smoothing out short-term environmental variability. Here, we document a widespread phenomenon of age (size)-truncation of exploited populations driven by size-selective fishery removals. Such size-selective fishing may have evolutionary consequence and may be difficult to reverse. In addition, fishing often reduces population spatial heterogeneity that also contributes importantly to bet-hedging. We review studies showing that the effects of age truncation and reduction of spatial heterogeneity have reduced resilience and elevated the fluctuation amplitude of exploited populations facing a changing environment. Recent analyses indicated that fish populations often exhibit nonlinear nature and have potential to shift dramatically in a short time. All the evidence suggests that fishing, by altering age or spatial structures, may make exploited fishes, more prone to catastrophic shifts. Therefore, to achieve sustainable fisheries, management should conserve the age and spatial structure in addition to viable spawning biomass.},

	abstract = {Recent studies of lakes suggest that the relative availability of light and phosphorus in the mixed layer helps determine the quality of phytoplankton consumed by herbivorous zooplankton. In turn, increases in algal quality positively affect zooplankton growth and reproductive rates. However, these studies have concentrated on explaining variation among lakes over relatively short time periods and have not evaluated the temporal dynamics in the physical-chemical forcing on zooplankton production. We investigated whether there were seasonal changes in the relationship between Daphnia fecundity and the physical-chemical environment, algal community characteristics, and Daphnia length using dynamic linear models ({DLM}) to analyze a high-resolution, 16-yr time series from Lake Washington. We used two metrics to describe algal quality: the percentage of blue-green algae and the light to total phosphorus ({TP}) ratio as an indirect metric for algal C : P. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and algal biovolume served as measures of algal quantity. As expected, both the light : {TP} ratio and the percentage of blue-green algae had negative effects on Daphnia fecundity, and Chl a concentration and biovolume had positive effects on fecundity. However, we found a comparatively stronger effect of Daphnia length on fecundity, although it was negative and therefore opposite to expectation. In all cases, we observed strong seasonal differences in environmental effects, but no temporal change in the fundamental relationships between our indices of algal quantity and quality, allometry, and Daphnia reproduction. Our results support a hypothesis of physical-chemical coupling to algal quality and zooplankton production but highlight the importance of temporal variation in this forcing.},

We tested this model using Rana temporaria tadpoles as prey and   Aeshna cyanea dragonfly larvae as predators. As assumed by the model,   prey reduced risky activity with increasing concentrations of predator   kairomones and increased activity at high prey density. However, prey   did not react to changes in cue or density if the ratio of   cue-to-density remained constant. Prey therefore monitored their per   capita risk, strongly supporting Peacor's model.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure p$_{\textrm{D}}$ for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general p$_{\textrm{D}}$ approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher\&rsquo;s information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the \&lsquo;hat\&rsquo; matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding p$_{\textrm{D}}$ to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals.

	abstract = {Ecologists have greatly advanced our understanding of the processes that regulate trophic structure and dynamics in ecosystems. However, the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation, but only recent empirical quantification. Here, we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores, detritus and decomposers, and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably, with less herbivory, more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic-terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity, indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size-structured, while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate, size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food-web architecture (food chain length, the prevalence of omnivory, specialization or anti-predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community.},

This source of mortality creates a challenge of incorporating species interactions in statistical catch-at-age models in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in input data, parameters, and results. We developed a statistical, age-structured, multispecies model for three important species in the Georges Bank fish community: Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The model was fit to commercial catch, survey, and diet data from 1978 to 2007. The estimated predation rates were high, compared with fishing mortality, and variable with time. The dynamics of the three species can be explained by the interplay between fishing and predation mortality. Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the ability of the model to estimate parameters with known error introduced into each of the data types. The model parameters could be estimated with confidence from input data with error levels similar to those obtained from the model fit to the observed data. This evaluation of model performance should help to move multispecies statistical catch-at-age models from proof of concept to functional tools for ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

However, a prerequisite for restoration is a general understanding of the composition and abundance of unexploited fish communities, relative to contemporary ones. We constructed trajectories of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning of exploitation. Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80\% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10\% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the 'missing baseline' needed for future restoration efforts.},

Lack of age-specific demographic information, particularly for long-lived iteroparous species, has impeded development of useful models. We use Lefkovitch stage class matrix model, based on preliminary life table developed by Frazer (1983@a), to point to interim management measures and to identify those data most critical to refining our knowledge about the population dynamics of threatened loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Population projections are used to examine the sensitivity of Frazer's life table to variations in parameter estimates as well as the likely response of the population to various management alternatives. Current management practices appear to be focused on the least responsive life stage, eggs on nesting-beaches. Alternative protection efforts for juvenile loggerheads,such as using turtle excluder devices ({TEDs}), may be far more effective.},

We created an index comprising ten diverse public goals for a healthy coupled human–ocean system and calculated the index for every coastal country. Globally, the overall index score was 60 out of 100 (range 36–86), with developed countries generally performing better than developing countries, but with notable exceptions. Only 5\% of countries scored higher than 70, whereas 32\% scored lower than 50.

	abstract = {Species interactions that play out over large spatial scales are difficult to observe, particularly in the oceans. The current lack of empirical evidence for biologically meaningful interaction parameters likely delays the application of holistic management procedures. Here we estimate interactions during the early life history of fish across regions. We present separate and hierarchical Bayesian models that estimate the direction and strength of interactions between Atlantic cod and dominant pelagic fishes across much of their range in the North Atlantic. We test the hypothesis that small pelagic fish may reduce survival of cod at early life stages, and thereby contribute to the delayed recovery of depleted cod populations.   Significant regional variation exists between cod recruitment and Atlantic herring abundance with eight of 14 regions displaying a negative relationship, four regions displaying no relationship, and a positive relationship observed in two regions. In contrast, most regions where Atlantic mackerel co-occurs showed no relationship with cod recruitment, with the possible exception of Gulf of St. Lawrence and Celtic Sea regions. Regions with sprat or capelin as dominant pelagics also displayed weak or no relationship, although the probability of a negative interaction with sprat increased when time series autocorrelation was accounted for. Overall, the interaction between herring and young cod was found to be negative with 94\% probability, while the probability of negative interactions with mackerel was only 68\%. Our findings suggest that the strength of predation or competition effects on young cod varies among small pelagic species but appears consistently for Atlantic herring; this effect may need to be considered in recovery trajectories for depleted cod populations. The methods introduced here are applicable in the investigation of species interactions from time series data collected across different study systems.},

	abstract = {{AbstractOne} approach to better account for ecosystem considerations in fisheries science is to incorporate ecological interactions into conventional stock assessment models. The longfin inshore squid Loligo pealeii is one of two squid species of ecological and commercial significance in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. A surplus production model with quarterly time steps was fitted to longfin inshore squid total removal (fishing and predation removal) and tuned with fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, and predation-dependent indices to examine the effect of incorporating predation into a single-species model. Total consumption of squid by all predatory fish exceeded the landings in most years of this analysis. The model output indicated that biological reference points for longfin inshore squid differ considerably when predation removals are included. It appears that by not including predation, the model underestimates stock biomass and overestimates fishery surplus production. Short-term stochastic projections of such estimates demonstrate that increasing predation mortality and fishing mortality will decrease the biomass of longfin inshore squid. Failing to account for predation when performing stock assessments for longfin inshore squid and other similar forage species may misrepresent reference point estimates and result in management advice that could lead to biomass declines. We envision that the approach presented here will provide requisite information and a useful example towards improving the current modeling practices for longfin inshore squid and similar forage species.},

	doi = {10.1890/07-2002.1},
	abstract = {Changing environmental conditions set against a backdrop of high exploitation can result in severe consequences for commercially harvested stocks. The collapse of the Eastern Scotian Shelf cod (Gadus morhua L.) off eastern Canada was primarily due to overexploitation but may have been exacerbated by a widespread temperature decline. Recent studies have called for accurate determination of ambient temperature (the actual temperature exposure history of the fish) before discarding environmental conditions as a factor in the collapse. We used the stable oxygen isotope composition of otoliths (delta(18)O(oto)) to reconstruct the ambient temperature history of Eastern Scotian Shelf cod from 1970 to 2000 in order to determine whether the stock experienced the temperature decline or shifted their distribution to avoid it. To correct delta(18)O(oto) for seawater isotope content (delta O(w)), we generated a new meta-equation for the relationship between delta(18)O(w) (per mil) and salinity (S, in psu) on the Eastern Scotian Shelf: delta(18)O(w) = 0.539 x S - 18.790. The ambient temperature series revealed that the large-scale geographic distribution of mature cod remained constant through the cooling period, although their ambient temperature was cooler than expected in warmer periods and warmer than expected in cooler periods, indicating small-scale thermoregulatory movement. Although the mean hydrographic temperature was 4 degrees C, mature cod usually inhabited the coldest available waters (mean ambient temperature = 3 degrees C), while the juveniles usually inhabited warmer waters (mean ambient temperature = 5.5 degrees C). Length-at-age was significantly related to ambient temperature, especially in the early years of growth, and therefore declining ambient temperatures were at least partially responsible for declines in asymptotic length (up to age 8 yr). The most active thermoregulatory movement occurred during a moderate warming period; therefore extreme warming events (such as those predicted under climate change) may force large-scale northward latitudinal shifts in this historically sedentary stock. Retroactive stable isotope chronologies can be an important tool in sustainable management strategies under the shifting climate conditions predicted for years to come.},

An alternative to this view, that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low-trophic-level fisheries ("fishing through the food web"), may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide, we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically, only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper-trophic-level species, compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n = 6) or significant increases (n = 15) in upper-trophic-level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6785-11-1},
	abstract = {Background: Interference competition occurs when access to resources is   negatively affected by the presence of other individuals. Within a   species or population, this is known as mutual interference, and it is   often modelled with a scaling exponent, m, on the number of predators.   Originally, mutual interference was thought to vary along a continuum   from prey dependence (no interference; m = 0) to ratio dependence (m =   -1), but a debate in the 1990's and early 2000's focused on whether prey   or ratio dependence was the better simplification. Some have argued more   recently that mutual interference is likely to be mostly intermediate   (that is, between prey and ratio dependence), but this possibility has   not been evaluated empirically.Results: We gathered estimates of mutual   interference from the literature, analyzed additional data, and created   the largest compilation of unbiased estimates of mutual interference yet   produced. In this data set, both the alternatives of prey dependence and   ratio dependence were observed, but only one data set was consistent   with prey dependence. There was a tendency toward ratio dependence   reflected by a median m of -0.7 and a mean m of -0.8.Conclusions:   Overall, the data support the hypothesis that interference is mostly   intermediate in magnitude. The data also indicate that interference   competition is common, at least in the systems studied to date.   Significant questions remain regarding how different factors influence   interference, and whether interference can be viewed as a characteristic   of a particular population or whether it generally shifts from low to   high levels as populations increase in density.},

However, diversity–stability relationships ({DSRs}) are analysed using a variety of different population and community properties, most of which are adopted from theory that makes several restrictive assumptions that are unlikely to be reflected in nature. Here, we construct a simple synthesis and generalisation of previous theory for the {DSR}. We show that community stability is a product of two quantities: the synchrony of population fluctuations, and an average species-level population stability that is weighted by relative abundance. Weighted average population stability can be decomposed to consider effects of the mean-variance scaling of abundance, changes in mean abundance with diversity and differences in species' mean abundance in monoculture. Our framework makes explicit how unevenness in the abundances of species in real communities influences the {DSR}, which occurs both through effects on community synchrony, and effects on weighted average population variability. This theory provides a more robust framework for analysing the results of empirical studies of the {DSR}, and facilitates the integration of findings from real and model communities.},

	abstract = {Genes, species and ecosystems are often considered to be assets. The need to ensure a sufficient diversity of this asset is being increasingly recognised today. Asset managers in banks and insurance companies face a similar challenge. They are asked to manage the assets of their investors by constructing efficient portfolios. They deliberately make use of a phenomenon observed in the formation of portfolios: returns are additive, while risks diversify. This phenomenon and its implications are at the heart of portfolio theory. Portfolio theory, like few other economic theories, has dramatically transformed the practical work of banks and insurance companies. Before portfolio theory was developed about 50 years ago, asset managers were confronted with a situation similar to the situation the research on biodiversity faces today. While the need for diversification was generally accepted, a concept that linked risk and return on a portfolio level and showed the value of diversification was missing. Portfolio theory has closed this gap. This article first explains the fundamentals of portfolio theory and transfers it to biodiversity. A large part of this article is then dedicated to some of the implications portfolio theory has for the valuation and management of biodiversity.

We described patterns of predation on rockfishes Sebastes spp. by lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, a top predator in nearshore rocky reef communities along the West Coast of North America, to improve our understanding of the variability, magnitude, and constraints of lingcod feeding on rockfishes. From spring 2004 through fall 2005 we collected diet data from 560 lingcod in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington. Rockfishes were a common component of adult lingcod diets, making up 6.8\% of the total diet by number, 11.0\% by mass, and 10.5\% by frequency of occurrence. Rockfishes were consumed by lingcod in all of the time periods and locations sampled during this study, but rockfish mass and frequency of occurrence in lingcod stomachs varied temporally and spatially. The total mass of rockfish consumed by lingcod during fall 2005 was estimated to be approximately three times as high in marine reserves as in nearby nonreserve areas, providing preliminary evidence for differences in community structure between protected areas and those open to harvest of bottom fish. Prey size spectra demonstrated that lingcod are capable of ingesting rockfish larger than 25 cm in standard length ({SL}), but the diet data suggest that they more commonly consume rockfish measuring 4-24 cm {SL}, including the adult stages of the small-bodied Puget Sound rockfish S. emphaeus and possibly the juvenile stages of larger rockfish such as copper rockfish S. caurinus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. These findings will inform development of future modeling and empirical studies that will ultimately provide improved insight into the relative top-down effects of lingcod predation and fishing on rockfish populations.},

For each of the stocks, two hypotheses were tested: (i) recruitment is significantly related to spawning stock biomass, climatic forcing, and feeding conditions and (ii) by acknowledging these drivers, management decisions can be improved. Climate impact expressed by climatic indices or changes in water temperature was included in all the final models. Recruitment of the herring stock appeared to be influenced by different factors: the spawning stock biomass, winter Baltic Sea Index prior to spawning, and potentially the November–December sea surface temperature during the winter after spawning were important to Gulf of Riga Herring, while the final models for Central Baltic Herring included spawning stock biomass and August sea surface temperature. Recruitment of sprat appeared to be influenced by July–August temperature, but was independent of the spawning biomass when {SSB} \&gt; 200,000 tons. Recruitment of Eastern Baltic Cod was significantly related to spawning stock biomass, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index, and the reproductive volume in the Gotland Basin in May. All the models including extrinsic factors significantly improved prediction ability as compared to traditional models, which account for impacts of the spawning stock biomass alone. Based on the final models the minimum spawning stock biomass to derive the associated minimum recruitment under average environmental conditions was calculated for each stock. Using uncertainty analyses, the spawning stock biomass required to produce associated minimum recruitment was presented with different probabilities considering the influence of the extrinsic drivers. This tool allows for recruitment to be predicted with a required probability, that is, higher than the average 50\% estimated from the models. Further, this approach considers unfavorable environmental conditions which mean that a higher spawning stock biomass is needed to maintain recruitment at a required level.},

However, an integrated view on the relative roles of top-down (consumer-driven) and bottom-up (resource-driven) forcing in large-scale, exploited marine ecosystems is emerging. Long time series of scientific survey data, underpinning the management of commercially exploited species such as cod, are being used to diagnose mechanisms that could affect the composition and relative abundance of species in marine food webs. By assembling published data from studies in exploited North Atlantic ecosystems, we found pronounced geographical variation in top-down and bottom-up trophic forcing. The data suggest that ecosystem susceptibility to top-down control and their resiliency to exploitation are related to species richness and oceanic temperature conditions. Such knowledge could be used to produce ecosystem guidelines to regulate and manage fisheries in a sustainable fashion.},

Environments supporting both dominant and subordinate competitors were found to increase survival of subordinate competitors at lower total competitor densities. Competitive environments during development within individual stage cohorts (i.e. small or large larvae), differed from the competitive environment in lumped age classes (i.e. development from egg→pupae). * 4Competition within mixed-age, stage or species cohorts, when compared with uniform-aged or species cohorts, altered the position of a competitive environment on the scramble-contest spectrum. In some cases the competitive environment switched from undercompensatory contest to overcompensatory scramble competition. * 5Such switching modes of competition suggest that the relative importance of the mechanisms regulating single-species population dynamics (i.e. resource competition) may change when organisms are embedded within a wider community.},

Many of these forecasts use ecosystem models rather than age-structured population models to describe upper trophic level ({UTL}) species. We illustrate the potential effects of climate on age-structured populations, then illustrate the ways in which ecosystem models might not depict adequately: (i) long-term changes in abundance, and (ii) variability attributable to cohort resonance. We simulated two generic species with different life histories, a short-lived semelparous species (e.g. salmon), and a long-lived iteroparous species (e.g. cod). For both species, juvenile survival was varied, first with white noise, then with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as environmental signals. Variability in recruitment increased with fishing and became particularly sensitive to forcing at time-scales near the mean age of reproduction, consistent with the cohort resonance effect. Ecosystem models without age structure do not predict this behaviour, particularly when the ecosystem model incorrectly predicts the effective steepness of the stock recruitment relationship, or the age structure is approximated by a stage-structured model. We suggest that ecosystem models of {UTLs} include full representations of age structure, fitted to available population data.},

	volume = {66},
	abstract = {Development of quantitative tools to characterize the nature of predator–prey interactions is an essential component of the science supporting ecosystem-based management and conservation. A common constraint is our capacity to estimate the feeding rates of fishes at the temporal and spatial scales at which predation occurs. This study developed a new field-based modeling approach for estimating consumption rates of large predatory fishes that requires fewer assumptions and may be more flexible than other field-based methods. We compared the field-based model results with consumption estimates from a bioenergetics model for lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a top predator in nearshore rocky habitats along the west coast of North America. The models were used to determine population-level consumption of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) by lingcod in marine reserves and nonreserve areas in the San Juan Channel, Washington, {USA}. Based on these models, rockfish consumption by lingcod may have been 5–10 times greater in marine reserves than in nonreserves during fall and summer, 2005–2007. Understanding whether lingcod predation may limit the efficacy of marine reserves for rockfish recovery requires site-specific information on the abundance and size structure of lingcod and rockfishes.La mise au point d’outils quantitatifs pour caractériser la nature des interactions prédateurs–proies est un élément essentiel des bases scientifiques sur lesquelles s’appuient la gestion et la conservation centrées sur les écosystèmes. Un obstacle courant est la nécessité d’estimer les taux d’alimentation des poissons aux échelles temporelles et spatiales auxquelles se produit la prédation. Notre étude a développé une approche de modélisation basée sur le terrain pour estimer les taux de consommation des grands poissons prédateurs qui nécessite un moins grand nombre de présuppositions et qui est peut-être plus flexible que les autres méthodes basées sur le terrain. Nous comparons les résultats de notre modèle basé sur le terrain aux consommations estimées par un modèle bioénergétique chez la morue-lingue (Ophiodon elongatus), un prédateur supérieur dans les habitats rocheux littoraux le long de la côte occidentale de l’Amérique du Nord. Les modèles ont servi à déterminer la consommation de sébastes (Sebastes spp.) au niveau de la population par les morues-lingues dans des réserves marines et hors des réserves dans le chenal de San Juan, Washington, É.-U. D’après ces modèles, la consommation de sébastes par les morues-lingues a pu être plus élevée par un facteur de 5–10 dans les réserves marines que hors des réserves durant l’automne et l’été en 2005–2007. Pour comprendre si la prédation par les morues-lingues peut limiter l’efficacité des réserves marines dans le rétablissement des populations de sébastes, il sera nécessaire d’obtenir des informations spécifiques aux sites sur l’abondance et la structure en taille des morues-lingues et des sébastes.},

Adult and juvenile survival and adult and juvenile reproduction, respectively, were identified as the most limiting demographic factors. Empirical evidence from designed experiments with Sage Grouse has shown that these demographic factors respond markedly to habitat manipulations, especially brush manipulation. Several plausible management scenarios were evaluated with 100-year population projections generated through Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations), sampling from a normal probability distribution entraining the observed variability in each demographic parameter (95\% confidence limits). Habitat manipulations to achieve moderate levels (similar to 15\% canopy cover) of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) are recommended Regression analyses with power tests showed correspondence between hunting mortality and total mortality for juveniles and adults. Provided that habitat manipulations improve the survival of juveniles and adults, population viability may be conserved without reducing harvest by hunters.},

Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50- year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations ( {CalCOFI}) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age- truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

	abstract = {A separable catch-age stock assessment model that accommodates predation mortality is applied to the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. Three predators are incorporated in the model: arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). The effect of these predators is examined by defining the predation mortality as a type of fishery. The model is used to quantify changes in the relative fit to the survey, fishery, and predator data when the assumption of constant natural mortality is relaxed. Specifically, we examine the effect of assumptions regarding the functional feeding response, residual naturaly mortality, and uncertainty in predator biomass on stock assessment. Total natural mortality rates (including predation) tended to be higher than estimated from life history characteristics of the stock. Models that did not account for uncertainty in natural mortality underestimated uncertainty in current stock biomass by as much as 20\%. Our results indicate that independent estimates of survey selectivity, additional food habits data, and estimates of the feeding responses of predators to different prey densities are all needed to improve our ability to develop stock assessment models that address ecosystem concerns.

	abstract = {The relationships between biodiversity and stability were determined for both population and ecosystem traits in a long—term study of 207 grassland plots. Results demonstrate that biodiversity stabilizes community and ecosystem processes, but not population processes. Specifically, year—to—year variability in total aboveground plant community biomass was significantly lower in plots with greater plant species richness both for the entire 11—yr period and for the nine non—drought years. The change in total plant community biomass from before the drought to the peak of the drought was also highly dependent on species richness. For all three measures of total community biomass stability, multiple regressions that controlled for covariates showed similar significant relationships between plant diversity and stability. In contrast, year—to—year variability in species abundances was not stabilized by plant species richness for either all years or non—drought years. This difference between species vs. community biomass likely results from interspecific competition. When climatic variations harm some species, unharmed competitors increase. Such compensatory increases stabilize total community biomass, but cause species abundances to be more variable. These results support both the predictions of Robert May concerning the effects of diversity on population stability and the diversity—stability hypothesis as applied to community and ecosystem processes, thus helping to reconcile a long—standing dispute.

	abstract = {The loss of aquatic subsidies such as spawning salmonids is known to threaten a number of terrestrial predators, but the effects on alternative prey species are poorly understood. At the heart of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, an invasion of lake trout has driven a dramatic decline of native cutthroat trout that migrate up the shallow tributaries of Yellowstone Lake to spawn each spring. We explore whether this decline has amplified the effect of a generalist consumer, the grizzly bear, on populations of migratory elk that summer inside Yellowstone National Park ({YNP}). Recent studies of bear diets and elk populations indicate that the decline in cutthroat trout has contributed to increased predation by grizzly bears on the calves of migratory elk. Additionally, a demographic model that incorporates the increase in predation suggests that the magnitude of this diet shift has been sufficient to reduce elk calf recruitment (4–16\%) and population growth (2–11\%). The disruption of this aquatic–terrestrial linkage could permanently alter native species interactions in {YNP}. Although many recent ecological changes in {YNP} have been attributed to the recovery of large carnivores—particularly wolves—our work highlights a growing role of human impacts on the foraging behaviour of grizzly bears.},

Age-structured models, however, predict substantially lower surplus production rates during population recovery than during decline because of reduced mean fecundity, unless recruitment compensation is very strong. Ecosystem models like Ecosim predict more complex patterns, with reduced production during recoveries due to both age-structure effects and cultivation-depensation effects related to changes in competitor and predator abundances. Production-driven recoveries, where surplus production per biomass is higher during recovery than decline, are predicted in cases where there has been substantial change in overall ecosystem productivity or community structure. 110 case examples illustrate that simple, repeatable relationships between stock size and production are uncommon, and the most common pattern is production-driven change in stock size, where changes in production rate apparently independent of stock size then drive stock increase or decrease. We conclude that nonstationarity in productivity needs to be considered as part of population rebuilding and that empirical estimates of surplus production may provide insight in this process.},

The implications of these cascading processes on system functioning and resilience remain a source of intense scientific debate. By using field data covering a 30-year period, we show for the Baltic Sea that the underlying mechanisms of trophic cascades produced a shift in ecosystem functioning after the collapse of the top predator cod. We identified an ecological threshold, corresponding to a planktivore abundance of approximate to 17 x 10(10) individuals, that separates 2 ecosystem configurations in which zooplankton dynamics are driven by either hydroclimatic forces or predation pressure. Abundances of the planktivore sprat above the threshold decouple zooplankton dynamics from hydrological circumstances. The current strong regulation by sprat of the feeding resources for larval cod may hinder cod recovery and the return of the ecosystem to a prior state. This calls for the inclusion of a food web perspective in management decisions.},

	abstract = {1. Understanding the interaction among predators and between predation and climate is critical to understanding the mechanisms for compensatory mortality. We used data from 1999 radio-marked neonatal elk (Cervus elaphus) calves from 12 populations in the north-western United States to test for effects of predation on neonatal survival, and whether predation interacted with climate to render mortality compensatory.   2. Weibull survival models with a random effect for each population were fit as a function of the number of predator species in a community (3-5), seven indices of climatic variability, sex, birth date, birth weight, and all interactions between climate and predators. Cumulative incidence functions ({CIF}) were used to test whether the effects of individual species of predators were additive or compensatory.   3. Neonatal elk survival to 3 months declined following hotter previous summers and increased with higher May precipitation, especially in areas with wolves and/or grizzly bears. Mortality hazards were significantly lower in systems with only coyotes (Canis latrans), cougars (Puma concolor) and black bears (Ursus americanus) compared to higher mortality hazards experienced with gray wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus horribilis).   4. In systems with wolves and grizzly bears, mortality by cougars decreased, and predation by bears was the dominant cause of neonatal mortality. Only bear predation appeared additive and occurred earlier than other predators, which may render later mortality by other predators compensatory as calves age. Wolf predation was low and most likely a compensatory source of mortality for neonatal elk calves.   5. Functional redundancy and interspecific competition among predators may combine with the effects of climate on vulnerability to predation to drive compensatory mortality of neonatal elk calves. The exception was the evidence for additive bear predation. These results suggest that effects of predation by recovering wolves on neonatal elk survival, a contentious issue for management of elk populations, may be less important than the composition of the predator community. Future studies would benefit by synthesizing overwinter calf and adult-survival data sets, ideally from experimental studies, to test the roles of predation in annual compensatory and additive mortality of elk.},

Population dynamics of small pelagic fish may therefore be regulated neither strictly bottom-up nor top-down, but rather through multiple external and internal drivers. While in many studies single drivers have been identified, potential synergies of multiple factors, as well as their relative importance in regulating population dynamics of small pelagic fish, is a largely unresolved issue. Using a statistical, age-structured modeling approach, we demonstrate the relative importance and influence of bottom-up (e.g., climate, zooplankton availability) and top-down (i.e., fishing and predation) factors on the population dynamics of Bothnian Sea herring (Clupea harengus) throughout its life cycle. Our results indicate significant bottom-up effects of zooplankton and interspecific competition from sprat (Sprattus sprattus), particularly on younger age classes of herring. Although top-down forcing through fishing and predation by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) also was evident, these factors were less important than resource availability and interspecific competition. Understanding key ecological processes and interactions is fundamental to ecosystem-based management practices necessary to promote sustainable exploitation of small pelagic fish.},

Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

Contrary to this claim, I argue that such ''ratio-dependent'' functional responses are very unlikely to occur on theoretical grounds and have not been shown empirically. Previous justifications for ratio-dependent functional responses ignore the role of these responses in determining prey population dynamics. Patterns in the abundances of trophic levels and experimental results that have been cited as support for ''ratio-dependent'' predation are consistent with numerous other explanations. These other explanations do not suffer from the pathological behaviors and lack of a plausible mechanism that afflict ratio-dependent models. Furthermore, ratio-dependent functional responses, because of their lack of a mechanistic basis, do not provide a good basis for developing more detailed models. Nor can the use of ratio-dependent models be justified as a limiting case of more general predator-dependent models.},

We compared the results of 3 studies that assessed the diets of Atlantic cod from Passamaquoddy Bay, Maine, {USA}, spanning 100 yr, using diet summary statistics to compare historical and modern datasets. We found that 1965 cod consumed fewer invertebrates than cod caught in 1896, but that cod caught in the period 2005 to 2008 ate diet items more similar to the 1896 fish. Large cod caught in the summer of 1965 primarily ate fish, particularly Atlantic herring, whereas few fish were found in the diets of 2005 cod. Documented changes in diet may reflect changes in technology and resource exploitation that altered the prey field available to cod over time. In the 1890s, the herring and finfish fisheries were widespread and landings were large, but other components of the food web, particularly invertebrates, were comparatively unexploited. Impacts on the benthos of Passamaquoddy Bay increased by the 1960s with the widespread use of heavy dredge and trawl gear. By 2005, most fisheries had abandoned Passamaquoddy Bay, and cod and herring were reduced in numbers. Ecosystem resilience can be seen in the return of modern cod to the 1896 diet, but compensatory dynamics in the food web appear to have favored benthic, then pelagic, and finally a 'balance' of diet constituents, but with fewer commercially important finfish in the ecosystem overall. When and where the data exist, 18th and 19th century accounts of fishery activity can be used to put modern trends in perspective.},

	abstract = {The dependence of long-term fishery yields on primary productivity, largely based on cross-system comparisons and without reference to the potential dynamic character of this relationship, has long been considered strong evidence for bottom-up control in marine systems. We examined time series of intensive empirical observations from nine heavily exploited regions in the western North Atlantic and find evidence of spatial variance of trophic control. Top-down control dominated in northern areas, the dynamics evolved from bottom-up to top-down in an intermediate region, and bottom-up control governed the southern areas. A simplified, trophic control diagram was developed accounting for top-down and bottom-up forcing within a larger region whose base state dynamics are bottom-up and can accommodate time-varying dynamics. Species diversity and ocean temperature co-varied, being relatively high in southern areas and lower in the north, mirroring the shifting pattern of trophic control. A combination of compensatory population dynamics and accelerated demographic rates in southern areas seems to account for the greater stability of the predator species complex in this region.},

	abstract = {The current status of and future trends for the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus population are assessed using information from aerial counts of pup abundance. The model used in the analyses is age- and sex-structured, and assumes density-dependence in the survival rate of pups. Uncertainty is assessed by conducting sensitivity tests and estimating 90\% confidence intervals by the percentile method. The results confirm the increase of the seal population since the introduction of legal controls at the end of the 19th century, and the estimate of 1,7 million animals of Age 1 and older at the start of 1993 is relatively robust to model assumptions and values for biological parameters. The food consumption by the seal population is estimated to have almost doubled between 1973 and 1993, and to be roughly 2 million tons annually at present. Future trajectories of seal numbers and annual consumption of food cannot be determined with great precision and are sensitive to the values assumed for the post-first-year survival rate and the degree of compensation in density-dependence. Depending on such assumptions, the seal population could already have reached its pre-exploitation equilibrium level or still be well below this level. Data from the 1993 aerial survey have considerable influence on the model results, and particularly on inferences concerning whether the population is now approaching its pre-exploitation level. This suggests that further surveys should be conducted to ascertain the reliability of the changed trend in pup abundance indicated by that 1993 count.},

Predator effects varied considerably among systems and were strongest in lentic and marine benthos and weakest in marine plankton and terrestrial food webs. Predator effects on herbivores were generally larger and more variable than on plants, suggesting that cascades often become attenuated at the plant-herbivore interface. Top-down control of plant biomass was stronger in water than on land; however, the differences among the five aquatic food webs were as great as those between wet and dry systems.},

Here we demonstrate that biological reference points generated by explicitly incorporating predation mortality into population dynamic models are generally more conservative (e.g., recommend higher standing biomass) than those produced using traditional assessment methods. Because biological reference points are the benchmark against which fisheries management decisions are made, they should reflect the ecological realities faced by each species to the fullest extent possible. We suggest much broader consideration of the more conservative biological reference points produced by explicitly incorporating predation mortality as a component of natural mortality to population models. This approach could implement a powerful yet tractable facet of ecosystem based fisheries management and is especially important for those stocks where predation mortality is known or suspected to be important.},

At large spatial and long temporal (10 years or longer) scales, hatching was correlated with the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom. Annual egg development and hatching times were determined locally by bottom water temperature. We conclude that different populations of P. borealis have adapted to local temperatures and bloom timing, matching egg hatching to food availability under average conditions.

	abstract = {* A financial portfolio metaphor is often used to describe how population diversity can increase temporal stability of a group of populations. The portfolio effect ({PE}) refers to the stabilizing effect from a population acting as a group or ‘portfolio’ of diverse subpopulations instead of a single homogeneous population or ‘asset’. A widely used measure of the {PE} (the average-{CV} {PE}) implicitly assumes that the slope (z) of a log–log plot of mean temporal abundance and variance (Taylor's power law) equals two.


* Existing theory suggests an additional unexplored empirical {PE} that accounts for z, the mean–variance {PE}. We use a theoretical and empirical approach to explore the strength and drivers of the {PE} for metapopulations when we account for Taylor's power law compared with when we do not. Our empirical comparison uses data from 51 metapopulations and 1070 subpopulations across salmon, moths and reef fishes.


* Ignoring Taylor's power law may overestimate the stabilizing effect of population diversity for metapopulations. The disparity between the metrics is greatest at low z values where the average-{CV} {PE} indicates a strong {PE}. Compared with the mean–variance method, the average-{CV} {PE} estimated a stronger {PE} in 84\% of metapopulations by up to sevenfold. The divergence between the methods was strongest for reef fishes (1·0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1·7) followed by moths (1·5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1·9). The {PEs} were comparable for salmon where z ≈ 2.


* We outline practical recommendations for estimating ecological {PEs} based on research questions, study systems and available data. Because most {PEs} were stabilizing and diversity can be slow to restore, our meta-analysis of metapopulations suggests that the safest management approach is to conserve biological complexity.},

Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that   the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error   and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement   data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we   model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic   processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis ({BCPA}), a   likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of   significant structural changes. The {BCPA} is robust to gappiness and   measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and   reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the   analysis to a {GPS} movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus   ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile,   and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the   {ARGOS} tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement   data, we suggest that the {BCPA} can eventually motivate the development   of mechanistic behavioural models.},

Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30–70\% increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40\% in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone ({EEZ}) regions in terms of their total landings, {EEZ} regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, {EEZ} regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Trophic cascades have been documented in a diversity of ecological systems and can be important in determining biomass distribution within a community. To date, the literature on trophic cascades has focused on whether and in which systems cascades occur. Many biological (e.g., productivity : biomass ratios) and methodological (e.g., experiment size or duration) factors vary with the ecosystem in which data were collected, but ecosystem type, per se, does not provide mechanistic insights into factors controlling cascade strength. Here, we tested various hypotheses about why trophic cascades occur and what determines their magnitude using data from 114 studies that measured the indirect trophic effects of predators on plant community biomass in seven aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31\% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18\% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems. Thus, although cascade strength can be described by biological characteristics of predators and herbivores, future research on indirect trophic effects must further examine biological and methodological differences among studies and systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An expansion of the {MSVPA} approach for quantifying predator–prey interactions in exploited fish communities. – {ICES} Journal of Marine Science, 67: 856–870.Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires tools to place fish-stock dynamics in the broader context of fishery, predator, and competitive removals. Multispecies virtual population analysis ({MSVPA}) is an approach to quantifying predator–prey interactions and estimating the rates of predation mortality for exploited fish populations. Here, an extended {MSVPA} ({MSVPA}-X) is presented as an alternative to existing {MSVPA} approaches. Notably, {MSVPA}-X uses index-tuned {VPA} methods, applies a more flexible feeding model, and includes an alternative functional feeding response. The {MSVPA}-X model is applied to a western Atlantic fish community, focusing on Atlantic menhaden and its major fish predators, and a sensitivity analysis of major model parameters is presented. The sensitivity analysis highlights the need for adequate diet sampling. The {MSVPA}-X represents an improvement over previous approaches by increasing the flexibility to model seasonal and interannual dynamics in the strength of predator–prey interactions. Model results demonstrate that, for menhaden in particular, and forage fish in general, quantifying predation mortality is an important part of effective assessments of forage fish, their predators, and the fisheries of both.},

Past single-species hypotheses examining the economic plausibility of exploiting rare species have argued that the escalating value of rarity allows extinction to be profitable. We describe an alternative pathway toward extinction in multispecies exploitation systems, termed ‘opportunistic exploitation’. In this mode, highly valued species that are targeted first by fishing, hunting, and logging become rare, but their populations can decline further through opportunistic exploitation while more common but less desirable species are targeted. Effectively, expanding exploitation to more species subsidizes the eventual extinction of valuable species at low densities. Managers need to recognize conditions that permit opportunistic depletion and pass regulations to protect highly desirable species when exploitation can expand to other species.},

Since 1959, Holling's prey-dependent Type {II} functional response, a model that is a function of prey abundance only, has served as the basis for a large literature on predator-prey theory. We present statistical evidence from 19 predator-prey systems that three predator-dependent functional responses (Beddington-{DeAngelis}, Crowley-Martin, and Hassell-Varley), i.e., models that are functions of both prey and predator abundance because of predator interference, can provide better descriptions of predator feeding over a range of predator-prey abundances. No single functional response best describes all of the data sets. Given these functional forms., we suggest use of the Beddington-{DeAngelis} or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high.},

Here, nonlinear behavior refers to non-equilibrium dynamics, including chaos. The population trajectories of all 26 species exhibited strong density-dependent feedback as indicated by a Partial Rate Correlation Function analysis. Significant evidence of complex dynamical behavior was found for approximately 1 in 5 species. Low dimensionality for many of the individual series was identified, suggesting that for a given level of predictability, this system can be represented by a relatively small number of critically important ecological variables. Further, we found high levels of co-predictability among pairwise combinations of individual species. We identified 4 major species groups sharing similar dynamic features on the basis of patterns of co-predictability, and explored potential mechanisms for interpreting the groupings in terms of trophic interactions and life history characteristics.},

The combination of current environmental conditions, fishing mortality rates, and stock size indicates that this fishery is not sustainable. In order to rebuild the population and sustain the fishery in the future, it is essential to define a biologically appropriate exploitation level. In this paper, we take a decision-theoretical approach and use risk analysis to compare different management actions in terms of fishing mortality rates, and predict stock size in a short, medium and long-term perspective. We consider alternative hypotheses about the stock biomass in 1999 and analyse the risk of stock decline below three thresholds: quasi-extinction (B-ext, defined by us), the safe biological limit, and the precautionary. approach limit as defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ({ICES}). Results show that the current fishing mortality implies a tremendous risk of driving the Baltic cod stock below B-ext (1000 t) within 10 yr. This result is robust to alternative assumptions about model structure as well as to the magnitude of environmental stochasticity. Hence, we consider a substantial reduction of the fishing mortality to be the only way of avoiding the far-reaching ecological and socio-economic consequences of continued exploitation at current levels.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Food webs in nature have multiple, reticulate connections between a diversity of consumers and resources. Such complexity affects web dynamics: it first spreads the direct effects of consumption and productivity throughout the web rather than focusing them at particular "trophic levels." Second, consumer densities are often donor controlled with food from across the trophic spectrum, the herbivore and detrital channels, other habitats, life-history omnivory, and even trophic mutualism. Although consumers usually do not affect these resources, increased numbers often allow consumers to depress other resources to levels lower than if donor-controlled resources were absent. We propose that such donor-controlled and "multichannel" omnivory is a general feature of consumer control and central to food web dynamics. This observation is contrary to the normal practice of inferring dynamics by simplifying webs into a few linear "trophic levels," as per "green world" theories. Such theories do not accommodate common and dynamically important features of real webs such as the ubiquity of donor control and the importance and dynamics of detritus, omnivory, resources crossing habitats, life history, nutrients (as opposed to energy), pathogens, resource defenses, and trophic symbioses. We conclude that trophic cascades and top-down community regulation as envisioned by trophic-level theories are relatively uncommon in nature.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {1. Abundant mid-trophic pelagic fish often play a central role in marine ecosystems, both as links between zooplankton and top predators and as important fishery targets. In the North Sea, the lesser sandeel occupies this position, being the main prey of many bird, mammal and fish predators and the target of a major industrial fishery. However, since 2003, sandeel landings have decreased by {\textgreater} 50\%, and many sandeel-dependent seabirds experienced breeding failures in 2004. 2. Despite the major economic implications, current understanding of the regulation of key constituents of this ecosystem is poor. Sandeel abundance may be regulated 'bottom-up' by food abundance, often thought to be under climatic control, or 'top-down' by natural or fishery predation. We tested predictions from these two hypotheses by combining unique long-term data sets (1973-2003) on seabird breeding productivity from the Isle of May, {SE} Scotland, and plankton and fish larvae from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We also tested whether seabird breeding productivity was more tightly linked to sandeel biomass or quality (size) of individual fish. 3. The biomass of larval sandeels increased two- to threefold over the study period and was positively associated with proxies of the abundance of their plankton prey. Breeding productivity of four seabirds bringing multiple prey items to their offspring was positively related to sandeel larval biomass with a 1-year lag, indicating dependence on 1-year-old fish, but in one species bringing individual fish it was strongly associated with the size of adult sandeels. 4. These links are consistent with bottom-up ecosystem regulation and, with evidence from previous studies, indicate how climate-driven changes in plankton communities can affect top predators and potentially human fisheries through the dynamics of key mid-trophic fish. However, the failing recruitment to adult sandeel stocks and the exceptionally low seabird breeding productivity in 2004 were not associated with low sandeel larval biomass in 2003, so other mechanisms (e.g. predation, lack of suitable food after metamorphosis) must have been important in this case. Understanding ecosystem regulation is extremely important for predicting the fate of keystone species, such as sandeels, and their predators.},

	abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that populations experiencing different levels of extrinsic mortality will evolve divergent reproductive strategies. Previous work in the live-bearing fish Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora shows that individuals from populations that occur with piscivorous fish mature earlier and at smaller sizes and have more and smaller offspring than fish from populations without predators. However, until now, there have been no data to demonstrate that differences in mortality rates actually exist between predator and predator-free sites. Here we present the results of a serial mark-recapture field study designed to estimate mortality rates in natural populations of B. rhabodophora from Costa Rica. We found that fish from predator environments experience higher overall mortality rates and proportionally higher adult mortality rates than fish from predator-free environments. We then ask what impact differences in mortality rates have on B. rhabdophora population dynamics. Using a population matrix modeling approach, we found that B. rhabdophora that co-occur with predators have population growth rates similar to those without predators and both have confidence intervals that span lambda = 1.0. However, elasticity analysis revealed that the most important life-history stages for population growth in predator environments are found early in life and include growth through early ontogenetic stages and survival as small adults; in contrast, the most important life-history stages for population growth in predator-free environments occur late in life, including survival once large juvenile and adult stages are reached. Hence, we demonstrate two important links between predation and population demography, one ecological due to the direct impacts of predator-induced mortality and the other expressed through predator-mediated reproductive adaptation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the drivers of the productivity of marine ecosystems continues to be a globally important issue. A vast body of literature identifies 3 main processes that regulate the production dynamics of fisheries: biophysical, exploitative, and trophodynamic. Here, we synthesize results from international workshops in which surplus production models were applied to 13 northern hemisphere ecosystems that support notable fisheries. The results are compared across systems, levels of species aggregation, and drivers. By applying surplus production models at single-species ({SS}), multi-species ({MS}), aggregated group, and full-system levels across ecosystems, we find that the different levels of aggregation provide distinct, but complementary, information. Further, it is clear that the triad of drivers contributes to fisheries productivity in each ecosystem, but the key drivers are system-specific. Our results also confirm that full-system yield is less than the sum of {SS} yields and that some {MS} and aggregate yields may lead to overharvest of some stocks if species groups are constructed without considering common productivity, inter-species, and environmental interactions. Several fundamental features emerge from this Theme Section including sigmoidal biomass accumulation curves across trophic levels, improvement of model fits by inclusion of environmental or ecological covariates, the inequality of system maximum sustainable yield ({MSY}) versus aggregated sums and {SS} sums of {MSY}, a 1 to 5 t km(-2) fishery yield rule of thumb, and the finding that tradeoffs among ocean use objectives may not be as harsh as originally thought. These emergent features have the potential to alter our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and improve how we manage fisheries production.},

This introductory essay examines aspects of control mechanisms in pelagic marine ecosystems and some of the issues discussed during the symposium and in the 11 papers that were selected for this special issue. At global scales, the greatest biomass of fishes, seabirds and marine mammals tends to occur in regions of the world ocean with high primary production, e.g., the sub-arctic seas and up-welling regions of continental shelves. These large-scale animal distribution patterns are driven by food availability, not the absence of predators. At regional scales however, it is likely that current predation or past predation events have shaped local distributions, at least in marine birds and pinnipeds. Wasp-waist control occurs when one of the intermediate trophic levels is dominated by a single species, as occurs with small pelagic fishes of the world’s up-welling zones. Processes in these ecosystems may have features that result in a switch from bottom-up to top-down control.},

After observation errors in population estimates were accounted for, temporal variability in natural mortality rate, annual recruitment, and population growth rate was negatively related to generation time. Mean natural mortality rate, annual recruitment, and population growth rate were lower in long-lived species than in short-lived species. Thus, important species-specific characteristics of the population dynamics were related to the species position along the slow-fast continuum of life-history variation. These relationships were further associated with interspecific differences in ecology: species at the fast end were mainly pelagic, with short generation times and high natural mortality, annual recruitment, and population growth rates, and also showed high temporal variability in those demographic traits. In contrast, species at the slow end were long-lived, deepwater species with low rates and reduced temporal variability in the same demographic traits. These interspecific relationships show that the life-history characteristics of a species can predict basic features of interspecific variation in population dynamical characteristics of marine fish, which should have implications for the choice of harvest strategy to facilitate sustainable yields.},

Presently, sustainable harvest levels for skates in the western Atlantic are unknown. Available life history information was used to model three western Atlantic skate species, little skate Leucoraja erinacea, winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, and barndooor skate Dipturus laevis, to determine their population growth rate and susceptibility to population decline under exploitation. Population characteristics were estimated using age-based matrix analyses for little and winter skate and a stage-based matrix approach for barndoor skate. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r) for little, winter and barndoor skates were 0.21, 0.13 and 0.20, respectively. Fishing mortality resulting in equilibrium conditions, where the intrinsic rate of increase is zero, were 0.35 for little skate, 0.16 for winter skate and 0.20 for barndoor skate. Elasticity analyses indicated that juvenile survival contributed most to Population growth in little skate and winter skate, and adult survival contributed the most in barndoor skate. Thus. conservation measures should focus on juvenile and adult stages of these species. fit the absence of fishing mortality, elasticity of fecundity was low for all species, however: at high exploitation levels the contribution of fecundity to Population growth rate increased. Stochastic analyses were performed by varying first year mortality (egg stage to the completion of one year of life), and model parameters for each species to generate estimates of the distributions of biological reference points. Our Study supports the finding that long-lived. slower growing, late maturing species are highly Vulnerable to exploitation. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The status of this stock is ambiguous at a time when catch appears to be on the rise and new trade and exploitation patterns are emerging. This research provides fishery-independent demographic and risk analysis results for use in conservation and management. An age-structured matrix population model in which the vital rates are stochastic was constructed. A mean finite rate of population increase (lambda) of 1.23 year(-1) and a mean population doubling time (t(2)) of 3.08 years suggests that the blue shark is one of the most productive shark species. However, this concept of high productivity could be misleading because an elasticity analysis shows a strong dependence of the population growth rate on the survival of juveniles (0-4 years). An analysis of the risk that the harvested population will decline to levels below an assumed threshold of 50\% of pre-exploited levels was conducted. The risk analysis is proposed as a supplement to the data-limited stock assessment, to better evaluate the probability that a given management strategy will put the population at risk of decline.},

We study this question using a model of prey defenses in which prey can induce any level of defense conditional on cues that are informative of local predator density. The model incorporates a trade-off between defense expression and fecundity and feedback between the defense level of prey and predator attack rates. Both continuous reaction norms and threshold traits can emerge as evolutionarily stable solutions of defense induction, and we show that the shape of the trade-off curve plays a key role in determining the outcome. Threshold traits are favored when selection is disruptive. Ecological conditions that favor defense dimorphisms in the absence of cues will favor threshold traits in the presence of slightly informative cues. We caution that continuous reaction norms and threshold traits may result in similar patterns of defense expression at the population level, and we discuss potential pitfalls of inferring reaction norm type from observational data.},

Traditionally, studies have sought to distinguish between the two most prominent drivers, ‘bottom-up’ (resource driven) and ‘top-down’ (consumer driven); however, this dichotomy is increasingly proving to be artificial as the relative importance of each mechanism has been shown to vary through space and time. Nevertheless, the reason why one predominates over another within a region remains largely unknown. To address this gap in understanding, we identified the dominant driver of commercial landings within 47 ecosystems, encompassing a wide range of biogeochemical conditions and fishing practices to elucidate general patterns. We show that bottom-up and top-down effects vary consistently with past fishing pressure and oceanographic conditions; bottom-up control predominates within productive, overfished regions and top-down in relatively unproductive and under-exploited areas. We attribute these findings to differences in the species composition and oceanographic properties of regions, together with variation in fishing practices and (indicative) management effectiveness. Collectively, our analyses suggest that despite the complexity of ecological systems, it is possible to elucidate a number of generalities. Such knowledge could be used to increase the parsimony of ecosystem models and to move a step forward in predicting how the global ocean, particularly fisheries productivity, will respond to climate change.},

Predator density may be an important component of these interactions between predator species, as the frequency of interactions between species is largely determined by species density.

We show that aggressive interactions between the predatory shore crabs Carcinus maenas and Hemigrapsus sanguineus increased with predator density, yet did not increase as fast as negative interactions between conspecifics. At low density, interactions between conspecific and heterospecific predators had similar inhibitory impacts on predator function, whereas conspecific interference was greater than interference from heterospecifics at high predator density. Thus the impact of conspecific interference at high predator density was sufficient in itself that interactions with a second predator species had no additional impact on per capita predation. Spatial and temporal variability in predator density is a ubiquitous characteristic of natural systems that should be considered in studies of multiple predator species.},

One option to achieve this goal is the multispecies virtual population analysis ({MSVPA}); however, its lack of statistical assumptions does not allow the use of tools used in single-species stock assessment. We chose to use a two-species system, walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), to incorporate the predation equations from {MSVPA} into an age-structured multispecies statistical model ({MSM}). Results suggest that both models produced similar estimates of suitability coefficients and predation mortalities. The adult population estimates from the single-species stock assessment and {MSM} were also comparable. {MSM} provides a measure of parameter uncertainty, which is not available with the {MSVPA} technologies. {MSM} is an important advancement in providing advice to fisheries managers because it incorporates the standard tools such as Bayesian methods and decision analysis into a multispecies context, helping to establish useful scenarios for management in the Bering Sea.},

	abstract = {A food-chain model based on trophic cascade theory predicts substantial variance in ecosystem function at time scales near the lifespan of the dominant predator. We tested this prediction using time series (1889-1982) of algal pigment concentrations in annually laminated sediments from a lake dominated by planktivorous fishes with lifespans of 3-5 yr. For pigments that are deposited in sediments mainly by herbivory and are known to be direct indicators of the trophic cascade (alloxanthin, pheophorbide a), variance was pronounced at scales similar to the fish lifespan, consistent with predictions of the model. Several other sedimentary pigments that have mainly pelagic sources (native chlorophylls, alpha-carotene) also had variance peaks consistent with predictions of the model. Pigments with multiple sources (fucoxanthin, lutein-zeazanthin, beta-carotene, pheophytin c) had only weakly significant or nonsignificant variance peaks. Pigments with mainly terrestrial sources (pheophytins a and b) had no variance peaks. These results indicate that some of the variance in this paleolimnological record is due to the trophic cascade. Since the scale of this variance component is almost-equal-to 3-5 yr, a 5-yr moving average filters out variance due to the trophic cascade. Residuals from the 5-yr moving average accentuate variance due to the trophic cascade. Filtering of the pheophytin time series revealed longer-term cycles (almost-equal-to 15 yr), which may arise from terrestrial or climatic processes.},

	abstract = {Forage fish play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about \$16.9 billion {USD} to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20\% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was \$5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable (\$11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes.},
